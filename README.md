# Linked Lists
A C Linked List Library Created For Personal Use. 

## Optimized for Access
Usually, Linked Lists cost Time Complexity of O(n) for accessing any element, but this library uses special algorithm that can drastically reduce Time Complexity for accessing elements.

Time Complexity Per Algorithm (For accessing elements)

Linear Search
- O(n): Accessing First Time
- O(1): Accessing more than 1 time/

Binary Search:
- O(n): Acccesing First Time
- O(log(n) : Accessing Second Time.
